### @chairmanbrando: It's an alias in an unaliased world.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on finding a job for the first time since 2008.
- 🙃 I only just learnt this readme was a thing at the tail end of 2024.
- 💬 Ask me about why `the_post` is probably my favorite WordPress hook.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning JavaScript things I'd accidentally ignored for years.
- 🤔 Most of my GitHub activity has been in private repositories.
- 📝 Tired of paying to take notes? Use [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/). I didn't make it; I just like and use it.
- 🖊️ I have a [mostly useless blog](https://chairmanbrando.org/) whose analytics I'm afraid to look at. It's probably all bots!
- 😸 Fun fact: I have two orange cats. Well, one's fully orange; the other's diluted to yellow.
