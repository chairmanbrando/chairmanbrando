- 🌱 I'm currently learning JavaScript things I'd accidentally ignored for years.
- 🤔 Most of my GitHub activity has been in private repositories. Oops?
- 📝 Tired of paying to take notes? Use [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/). I didn't make it; I just like and use it.
- 😸 Fun fact: I have two orange cats. Well, one's fully orange; the other's diluted to yellow.
